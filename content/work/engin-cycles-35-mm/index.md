# Engin Cycles 35MM Stem

These mountain bike stems were designed to match the design language of existing parts in the lineup, while being strong and lightweight, but still relatively easy to produce. The result is a striking asymmetrical design with an industrial look that exceeds ISO requirements for torsion and fatigue.

### Concept

The first full project I took on for Engin Cycles was the design of the 35MM Stem. The prompt was to create a stem to match the existing seat collar that was already in production and using the 35 mm clamping standard that was becoming popular in mountain bikes. The goal being to offer a more complete line of products, and offer a visual counterpart for the front end of the bike for a cohesive build for our customers.

### Visual Design

With a clear concept from the beginning and a clear design language already in place, the design process moved quite quickly. Drawing on the design language of the seat collar, and using the specifications as determined before the visual design began, the stem took form.
