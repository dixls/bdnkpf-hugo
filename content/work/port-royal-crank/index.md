# Engin Cycles Port Royal Crank

The Port Royal crankset for Engin Cycles was designed to evoke the classic styling of early mountain bike component design without sacrificing on modern performance. When designing the Port Royal crank I wanted to create something that wouldn't look out of place on custom bikes where modern components meet timeless craftsmanship.

### Modern Standards

One of the most important considerations in designing the Port Royal crankset was that it needed to use modern standards found on high end bikes today. By using SRAM's 3-bolt direct mount chainring standard and a 3 piece design with a 30 mm spindle, the Port Royal will easily find a home on any modern bike, with a plethora of compatible parts already available.

### Strong Enough for Port Royal

We named the Port Royal for a notoriously tough cobblestone climb here in Philadelphia. Port Royal Ave. is a short but steep climb with an array of pot holes and loose cobblestones that's never the same the next time you go for a visit. In order for this crankset to be just as tough as its namesake it was subjected to torture testing, including at the bike park. The result is two versions that at a glance are identical, the standard version as light as possible, and suitable for everything up to some XC mountain biking, and the HD, or heavy duty, version that will handle everything else. The tradeoff ends up being just ~60g, but I like light parts, so why not have the option?
