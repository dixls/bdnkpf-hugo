      <description>As part of the Keycraft Collective Spring Design Jam, I decided to design a keyboard inspired by indoor plant life. The prompt for the design jam was to create a design for something keyboard related inspired by springtime. My mind immediately went to plants and the fresh greenery that comes with spring. Knowing many people enjoy having small plants in their work area, I thought it would be fun to pursue that relationship in a direct and literal way.</description>
