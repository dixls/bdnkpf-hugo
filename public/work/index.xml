      <description>Engin Cycles Port Royal Crank The Port Royal crankset for Engin Cycles was designed to evoke the classic styling of early mountain bike component design without sacrificing on modern performance. When designing the Port Royal crank I wanted to create something that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t look out of place on custom bikes where modern components meet timeless craftsmanship.
     The Port Royal installed on a mountain bike with an Absolute Black chainring.</description>

      <description>Garden40 Concept Keyboard As part of the Keycraft Collective Spring Design Jam, I decided to design a keyboard inspired by indoor plant life. The prompt for the design jam was to create a design for something keyboard related inspired by springtime. My mind immediately went to plants and the fresh greenery that comes with spring. Knowing many people enjoy having small plants in their work area, I thought it would be fun to pursue that relationship in a direct and literal way.</description>

      <description>Engin Cycles 35MM Stem These mountain bike stems were designed to match the design language of existing parts in the lineup, while being strong and lightweight, but still relatively easy to produce. The result is a striking asymmetrical design with an industrial look that exceeds ISO requirements for torsion and fatigue.
     34.9 Seat Collar originally designed by Peter Verdone
  Concept The first full project I took on for Engin Cycles was the design of the 35MM Stem.</description>
